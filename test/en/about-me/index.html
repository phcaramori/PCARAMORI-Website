                projects and eager to find learning opportunities. I have over <span class="orange">1 year</span> of real-world work experience as a front-end developer, and have recently dove into back-end development technologies, with <span class="orange">6 months</span>                of experience.
                <br><br> I have been programming since I was <span class="orange">12</span>, and this website has existed ever since then. I love to share what I learn, and this website is a platform for that - it <span class="orange">evolves</span> together
                with me and my skills.

            <p>
                As I learnt to code, I made multiple projects to learn while practicing.
                <a href="../projects/">A full list can be seen here</a>, but the most notable of these was the Caretaker App. This is a <span class="orange">full mobile app</span> I began developing solo, in the second half of 2022. Over the course of
                6 months, I designed, prototyped, programmed and implemented this <span class="orange">cross-platform</span> mobile app. It is a marketplace which allows those in need to find caretakers to help them domestically. I had to learn
                <span class="orange">flutter</span>, <span class="orange">data structures</span>, <span class="orange">API integration</span> and multiple algorithms to sort results. The app has a built-in search, payment, customizable user profiles,
                and chat features.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2 style=" color: var(--orange-2) ">Learning</h2>
            <p>
                I learnt to code on the online platform <span class="orange">Codecademy</span>. I was presented to website programming by a friend when I was 12, and have used the platform since then. In the start, I only knew <span class="orange">
                    extremely basic HTML and
                    CSS
                </span>, creating my first ever website. However, over time, I began to <span class="orange">learn very quickly </span>and slowly began <span class="orange">detaching myself from the platform</span> and online tutorials. I developed
                <span class="orange">discord bots</span>, <span class="orange">servers</span>, <span class="orange">websites</span>, and <span class="orange">apps</span> to put my learning into practice, and to get a deeper understanding of the
                <span class="orange">underlying technologies</span> at use. Before using any type of abstraction, I like to understand what is going on below the hood. <span class="orange">Before</span> getting into react and JSX, I <span class="orange">mastered JavaScript</span>                - before learning SCSS, I mastered CSS. If I <span class="orange">understand what's going on behid the scenes, I can grasp the technology much faster.</span>

            <h2 style=" color: var(--orange-2) ">Brainsides</h2>
            <p>
                Since I was 14, I have worked part-time at Brainsides, a Brazilian development company. I began working as a video editor, but from 2020-2022 I began working as a <span class="orange
                    ">front-end</span> developer, helping <span class="orange ">create</span> and
                <span class=" orange ">style web pages</span>. Later in 2021, I also took on some back-end tasks ranging from <span class="orange ">API integration</span> to <span class="orange ">database management</span>.
