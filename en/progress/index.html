            <p>The first ever HTML page I made. Together with the "first page", also came a "first css" and a "second page", all of which are accessible <a href="FIX">here.</a> This was what I could come up with after less than like 10 hours of basic HTML
                lessons from codecademy, at age 11. (I'm still working on finding this. Hold tight!)</p>

            <h3 style="color:var(--green-2)">2/14/2018 - 2019</h3>
            <p>The first website I uploaded to be publically availible on the internet, on this very domain! See it in all of its 2018 glory <a href="/old/first-website/index.htm">here!</a> The story behind this website is quite simple: my friends and I
                wanted to play flash games at school, however, the school firewall blocked most of them. So, I made a website that mirrored those same flash games to circumvent the firewall! Also, for whatever reason, I signed this website up to earn
                money from google ads on the page. Believe it or not, they didn't accept the page into their adsense program... no clue why</p>

            <h3 style="color:var(--green-2)">2019 - 8/20/2020</h3>
            <p>The 'upgraded' version of my previous website. With many, many more games, and a cleaner layout, this was my magnum-opus. It even had some JavaScript! The biggest weakness, however, was how every single page/game was added by hand, one-by-one.
                This meant that if one link was wrong, I'd have to change it in all 70+ pages, which is why I gave up halfway through. Also, as falsh was about to be discontinued, there was no real reason for me to keep this one going. Accessible <a href="old/game/index.htm">here.</a></p>

            <p>No, it didn't take me 3 years worth of work to make this. With many other projects, this website ended up just taking a back seat, with tiny spurts of commits every few months. Almost everything, however, was made in 2023 when I picked up
                the development in a more consistent manner. The landing page is roughly the same from the original start back in 2020.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>From 2020-2022, this website served mainly as a sandbox for me to experiment in. Many of the features that are functioning here today came from other, smallers projects that I worked on (landing page, intro, theme changing, etc.) Learn more
